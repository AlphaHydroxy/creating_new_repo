The Pomeranian (often known as a Pom or Pom Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in Germany and Poland in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz ("Dwarf-Spitz").
